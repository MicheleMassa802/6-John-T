# 6-John-T
Ontario Parks 'Park Mindfulness' project, developed by EXgoblins (#6).

As of Deliverable 1, the details on the operation and usage of the program are not available yet.

However, to make navigation through the repo a little easier, here is our quickstart guide in terms of where to find everything.

1) The /documents folder is where everything concerned with planning of the project, team details, and all of the D1-related information can be found.
2) Within /documents/plannin.md, the logical structure for the project is laid out.
3) /miscellaneous and /mockup within /documents both contain images used throughout planning.md.
4) /documents/team/Team-6-EXgoblins.csv and Stakeholders.txt contain information on all of the team members making up EXgoblins, and the stakeholders of the project.
5) Lastly, the meeting minutes can be found at /documents/team/minutes, and there are two types of files there. There are the Partner-MM type, which contain records of our bi-weekly meetings with out partner and Ontario Parks Representative, John Leadston; and then there is the Team-MM-Stack, which is where team meeting minutes are collected in the form of a stack, such that the details on our most recent team meeting can be found at the top of the txt file.
