feedback from manager side frontend

- increase visibility of "create new bench" links by turning it into a button, other links as button instead
- have some picture of a park bench in the create bench page
- admin login
- add thumbnail and ability to change thumbnail

feedback from user side frontend

- simplistic is good
- qr code full functionality? not working on his phone
- have text or description underneath QR code as well
- qr codes can stay
- logo? not specific to ontario parks
- logo is park specific, different parks can be different logos
