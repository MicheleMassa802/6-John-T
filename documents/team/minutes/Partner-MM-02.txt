Feb 2 2023 meeting with partner John

Confirmed John can access the github repo
Went over proposal, specifically, the mockups, and the user stories, personas and got the following feedback:
- important to have bench specific info, different per park
- likes contributor feature
- likes audio switching/uploading
- john wants automatic switching audio for seasons? multiple audio per bench, set the active audio automatically
- asking about how long audio can be? let him know when we confirm the audio (towards the end of the project before deployment preferably)
- let him know the cost of maintaining storage before deployment
- broader personas, children, people in pain and reduce stress
- have history of visited benches? to simplify UX we do not have account creation
- simple user interface is good, not too many words
- clicking symbol directly instead of the arrow to go to audio
- plain colors or background image
- "any of our parks" text to change
- wondering if app is necessary? can use website
- have instruction on QR code explaining it
- scan and play feature on a different page

Scheduled next meeting for Feb 16 2-3
